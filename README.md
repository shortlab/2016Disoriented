TG Spectroscopy Orientation Paper - 2016

This paper describes a concerted effort to measure the absolute sensitivity of the transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) technique, as it applies to quantifying changes in elasticity of irradiated materials. This repository contains all the data, scripts, input files, output files, and additional information required to reproduce the major results, figures, and tables in this paper.
