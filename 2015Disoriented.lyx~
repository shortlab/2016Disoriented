\begin_layout Abstract
We demonstrate that classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be
 used to accurately simulate orientation-based changes in Young's modulus
 in transient grating (TG) experiments, by comparing with experimental measureme
nts and theoretical predictions.
 The agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment gives confidence
 in classical MD as a predictive tool to simulate defect-based changes in
 Young's modulus, which cannot yet be fully treated by theory.
 This ability is of critical importance when using TG spectroscopy to measure
 material property changes induced by radiation damage, which may vary by
 amounts formerly too small for reliable

 detection.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frontier of mesoscale science (MSS) is ripe with opportunities for discovery
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, with the ultimate goal of linking atomistic, unit processes with component-lev
el performance.
 Since its inception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Laughlin1999"

\end_inset

, those in the growing field of MSS seek to understand the mechanistic reasons
 for the evolution of material properties not just from defects, but also
 from defect populations, superstructures, and spatiotemporal variations.
 However, significant difficulty arises in the direct theoretical prediction
 and experimental measurement of mesoscale material properties.
 Theory often treats response functions, such as that of elasticity or thermal
 conductivity, as a superposition of a homogeneous medium with a mathematically
 convenient distribution of single defects.
 Analytical treatment of a complex material, containing a wide variety of
 defect types, sizes, and spatial distributions, is beyond mesoscale theory
 at the moment.
 In these cases experimental measurements can yield insights to elucidate
 underlying theories, though direct mesoscale measurements continue to prove
 difficult to perform, or even conceive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, one would develop experimental ideas based on a basis of theory,
 and then use simulations to understand the mechanism of the response.
 Another potential path for success is to use simulations as a predictive
 tool, validated by theory, to simultaneously guide and understand experimental
 measurements.
 For a field without a fully described theoretical framework, such as mesoscale
 radiation materials science, this second path is the only viable one.
 However, it cannot proceed without first rigorously validating the simulation
 framework using theoretical predictions and well-understood experimental
 measurements.
 In the absence of fully-developed theory, predictive simulations and experiment
al measurements must be able to directly show radiation-induced changes
 in material properties over mesoscale (10's to 100's of micron) volumes,
 with enough sensitivity to exclude confounding effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In radiation materials science, quantities like the Young's modulus must
 be reliably determined to 100's of parts per million (ppm).
 This is due to the fact that radiation-induced defects change elastic constants
 in well-defined, though small, amounts.
 Vacancies have been analytically and computationally shown to change elastic
 constants on the order one percent per percent concentration.
 Interstitial atoms are predicted to have an effect between two

 and ten

 times as strong in magnitude.
 These defects are found in levels from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{10^{-10}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{10^{-4}}$
\end_inset

 atom fraction for vacancies from room temperature to the melting point,
 respectively, and at levels thousands of times lower for interstitials.
 Radiation damage can increase vacancy concentrations to a theoretical maximum
 of one percent during intense irradiation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Averback1977"

\end_inset

.
 Irradiation can also create dislocations, which change the Young's modulus
 via Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Dislocation-Youngs-Modulus-Change"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{\pi k\rho_{\bot}L^{2}}{3\, ln\left(\frac{L}{\left|\overrightarrow{b}\right|}\right)\,}\label{eq:Dislocation-Youngs-Modulus-Change}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\emph on
E
\emph default
 is the Young's modulus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 is its change, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\bot}$
\end_inset

 is the dislocation density, L is the average dislocation pinned segment
 length, and k is unity for a screw dislocation, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-\nu\right)$
\end_inset

 for an edge dislocation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is the Poisson's ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Friedel1953"

\end_inset

.
 Voids are expected to reduce the Young's modulus by a magnitude on the
 order of their volume fraction.
 In all cases, resolving changes in the Young's modulus well below 1% is
 critical to the usage of TG spectroscopy as a mesoscale measurement technique
 for radiation damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One promising tool for direct, mesoscale measurements is transient grating
 (TG) spectroscopy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rogers2000"

\end_inset

.
 This technique projects a sinusoidal pattern of laser light onto a material
 on the order of 100 microns in width, allowing for direct mesoscale measurement
 of elastic constants, thermal conductivity, and acoustic damping of surface
 acoustic waves (SAWs).
 Its ability to discern changes in material properties due to underlying
 defect populations depends strongly on the repeatable sensitivity of the
 measurement itself.
 Because these material properties can be anisotropic in solid materials,
 knowing the precise surface-normal orientation 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 relative rotation of the crystal face are critical to the sensitivity of
 the measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measurement of the anisotropy of the Young's modulus provides a convenient
 method of validating both the experimental technique and the simulation
 approach at reliably discerning such small variations in Young's modulus.
 Here anisotropy is defined by the Zener anisotropy ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Anisotropy ratio"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A=\frac{2C_{44}}{\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\right)}\label{eq:Anisotropy ratio}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C_{ij}}$
\end_inset

 is the elastic constant in the ith row and the jth column of the elasticity
 tensor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zener1947"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, by simply rotating a single crystal of a material with a known
 elastic anisotropy, one can tune the expected change in Young's modulus
 from theory, while simultaneously measuring and predicting it using TG
 and MD, respectively.
 The ultimate test is to select materials with a very low degree of anisotropy,
 like aluminum, which exhibits the second lowest anisotropy ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A=1.22\right)$
\end_inset

 only to tungsten 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A=1.01\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Simmons1971"

\end_inset

, resulting in expected changes in SAW speed of fractions of a percent per
 degree of rotation.
 Radiation has even been shown to change the anisotropy ratio of tungsten
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hofmann2015"

\end_inset

, which would represent another test of the simulation and experimental
 techniques where theory is still lacking.
 Should orientation-based TG measurements made on materials like aluminum
 be discernible, they will simultaneously qualify the technique for the
 study of fine changes in Young's modulus, and set a lower bound on the
 noise-based sensitivity of the TG spectroscopy technique.
 In addition, correctly predicting these orientation-based changes in the
 TG signal will validate classical MD as a predictive tool for such small
 changes in Young's modulus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this manuscript, we show the application of transient grating (TG) spectrosco
py to measuring the Young's modulus within the limits of sensitivity for
 expected changes due to irradiation.
 We then hypothesize that classical MD can predict the linear elastic response
 of materials within levels expected to change due to irradiation.
 A lower size limit of ___nm for MD simulations is shown to retain excellent
 scaling with experiments to less than __% error.
