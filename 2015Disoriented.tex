\begin{abstract}
We demonstrate that classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
can be used to accurately simulate orientation-based changes in Young's
modulus in transient grating (TG) experiments, by comparing with experimental
measurements and theoretical predictions. The agreement between theory,
simulation, and experiment gives confidence in classical MD as a predictive
tool to simulate defect-based changes in Young's modulus, which cannot
yet be fully treated by theory. This ability is of critical importance
when using TG spectroscopy to measure material property changes induced
by radiation damage, which may vary by amounts formerly too small
for reliable \emph{in-situ} detection.

\section{Introduction}

The frontier of mesoscale science (MSS) is ripe with opportunities
for discovery \cite{Sarrao2015}, with the ultimate goal of linking
atomistic, unit processes with component-level performance. Since
its inception \cite{Laughlin1999}, those in the growing field of
MSS seek to understand the mechanistic reasons for the evolution of
material properties not just from defects, but also from defect populations,
superstructures, and spatiotemporal variations. However, significant
difficulty arises in the direct theoretical prediction and experimental
measurement of mesoscale material properties. Theory often treats
response functions, such as that of elasticity or thermal conductivity,
as a superposition of a homogeneous medium with a mathematically convenient
distribution of single defects. Analytical treatment of a complex
material, containing a wide variety of defect types, sizes, and spatial
distributions, is beyond mesoscale theory at the moment. In these
cases experimental measurements can yield insights to elucidate underlying
theories, though direct mesoscale measurements continue to prove difficult
to perform, or even conceive.

Ideally, one would develop experimental ideas based on a basis of
theory, and then use simulations to understand the mechanism of the
response. Another potential path for success is to use simulations
as a predictive tool, validated by theory, to simultaneously guide
and understand experimental measurements. For a field without a fully
described theoretical framework, such as mesoscale radiation materials
science, this second path is the only viable one. However, it cannot
proceed without first rigorously validating the simulation framework
using theoretical predictions and well-understood experimental measurements.
In the absence of fully-developed theory, predictive simulations and
experimental measurements must be able to directly show radiation-induced
changes in material properties over mesoscale (10's to 100's of micron)
volumes, with enough sensitivity to exclude confounding effects.

In radiation materials science, quantities like the Young's modulus
must be reliably determined to 100's of parts per million (ppm). This
is due to the fact that radiation-induced defects change elastic constants
in well-defined, though small, amounts. Vacancies have been analytically
and computationally shown to change elastic constants on the order
one percent per percent concentration. Interstitial atoms are predicted
to have an effect between two \cite{Chiesa2009} and ten \cite{Dienes1952,Nabarro1952,Dienes1952a}
times as strong in magnitude. These defects are found in levels from
$\mathrm{10^{-10}}$ to $\mathrm{10^{-4}}$ atom fraction for vacancies
from room temperature to the melting point, respectively, and at levels
thousands of times lower for interstitials. Radiation damage can increase
vacancy concentrations to a theoretical maximum of one percent during
intense irradiation \cite{Averback1977}. Irradiation can also create
dislocations, which change the Young's modulus via Equation \ref{eq:Dislocation-Youngs-Modulus-Change}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{\pi k\rho_{\bot}L^{2}}{3\, ln\left(\frac{L}{\left|\overrightarrow{b}\right|}\right)\,}\label{eq:Dislocation-Youngs-Modulus-Change}
\end{equation}
where \emph{E} is the Young's modulus, $\Delta E$ is its change,
$\rho_{\bot}$ is the dislocation density, L is the average dislocation
pinned segment length, and k is unity for a screw dislocation, and
$\left(1-\nu\right)$ for an edge dislocation, where $\nu$ is the
Poisson's ratio \cite{Friedel1953}. Voids are expected to reduce
the Young's modulus by a magnitude on the order of their volume fraction.
In all cases, resolving changes in the Young's modulus well below
1\% is critical to the usage of TG spectroscopy as a mesoscale measurement
technique for radiation damage.

One promising tool for direct, mesoscale measurements is transient
grating (TG) spectroscopy \cite{Rogers2000}. This technique projects
a sinusoidal pattern of laser light onto a material on the order of
100 microns in width, allowing for direct mesoscale measurement of
elastic constants, thermal conductivity, and acoustic damping of surface
acoustic waves (SAWs). Its ability to discern changes in material
properties due to underlying defect populations depends strongly on
the repeatable sensitivity of the measurement itself. Because these
material properties can be anisotropic in solid materials, knowing
the precise surface-normal orientation \emph{and} relative rotation
of the crystal face are critical to the sensitivity of the measurement.

Measurement of the anisotropy of the Young's modulus provides a convenient
method of validating both the experimental technique and the simulation
approach at reliably discerning such small variations in Young's modulus.
Here anisotropy is defined by the Zener anisotropy ratio $\left(A\right)$
in Equation \ref{eq:Anisotropy ratio}:
\begin{equation}
A=\frac{2C_{44}}{\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\right)}\label{eq:Anisotropy ratio}
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{C_{ij}}$ is the elastic constant in the ith row and
the jth column of the elasticity tensor \cite{Zener1947}. Therefore,
by simply rotating a single crystal of a material with a known elastic
anisotropy, one can tune the expected change in Young's modulus from
theory, while simultaneously measuring and predicting it using TG
and MD, respectively. The ultimate test is to select materials with
a very low degree of anisotropy, like aluminum, which exhibits the
second lowest anisotropy ratio $\left(A=1.22\right)$ only to tungsten
$\left(A=1.01\right)$ \cite{Simmons1971}, resulting in expected
changes in SAW speed of fractions of a percent per degree of rotation.
Radiation has even been shown to change the anisotropy ratio of tungsten
\cite{Hofmann2015}, which would represent another test of the simulation
and experimental techniques where theory is still lacking. Should
orientation-based TG measurements made on materials like aluminum
be discernible, they will simultaneously qualify the technique for
the study of fine changes in Young's modulus, and set a lower bound
on the noise-based sensitivity of the TG spectroscopy technique. In
addition, correctly predicting these orientation-based changes in
the TG signal will validate classical MD as a predictive tool for
such small changes in Young's modulus.

In this manuscript, we show the application of transient grating (TG)
spectroscopy to measuring the Young's modulus within the limits of
sensitivity for expected changes due to irradiation. We then hypothesize
that classical MD can predict the linear elastic response of materials
within levels expected to change due to irradiation. A lower size
limit of \_\_\_nm for MD simulations is shown to retain excellent
scaling with experiments to less than \_\_\% absolute error, and \_\_\%
relative error for different crystal orientations. This imparts confidence
in the ability of classical MD to predict the response of materials
with mesoscale defect populations, such as those due to irradiation,
where theory cannot yet describe them.
