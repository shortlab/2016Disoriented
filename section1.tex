%Introduction

\begin{itemize}
\item Desire to have a faster method of determining unknown crystallographic orientation
\item UK Group 
\begin{itemize}
\item Have velocity mapping method 
\item data is experimental and slow
\end{itemize}
\item Want to be able to make measurements faster and back them up with simulations instead of experimental libraries
\item Current experimental methods like EBSD, Laue Backscatter diffraction and XRD
\begin{itemize}
\item Big
\item Slow
\item Expensive
