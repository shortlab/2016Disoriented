%Discussion

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparing the MD and experimental data
\begin{itemize}
\item Implications for ease of determining the orientation of unknown crystal substrates
\end{itemize}
\item More anisotropic materials should be easier
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there theory anywhere that would let us make predictions about differing speeds on not only crystal faces but also directions on those faces? I want to know this anyway
\end{itemize}
\item Uncertainty
\begin{itemize}
\item Can talk about here or just find a convincing way to handle experimental uncertainty and include that in the results section, leaning towards the latter
\end{itemize}
\item New method for qualification of MD potentials?
\end{itemize}
